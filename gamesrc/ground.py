    This class represents the Ground in Flappy Bird. It uses two ground sprites
    and cycles them to give the illusion of moing ground. One sprite moves
    behind the other and when the first have dissapeared from the screen the
    sprite is recycled to the front.

    Some useful methods are:

    move() which should be called every game tick to figure out where the ground
    object has moved and where the pair ground object has to be drawn from.
